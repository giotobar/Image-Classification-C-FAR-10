# Image-Classification-C-FAR-10

Build an image classification model using multiple Deep Learning principles such as Fully Connected Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Regularization, Optimization, among other methods.

Most of these algorithms were created from scratch, meaning no framework was used to build these networks. They were mostly build by using NumPy library to
