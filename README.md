# Image-Classification-C-FAR-10

As part of a course at UCLA, built an image classifier model using multiple Deep Learning principles such as Fully Connected Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Regularization, Optimization, among other methods.

Most of these algorithms were created from scratch, meaning no framework was used to build these networks. They were mostly built using NumPy library in order to  better understand how these concepts operate when applied to real-world tasks.
